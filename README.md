IT Support Graduated and a hobby game tester
### **Education**

In 2017 I have enrolled into High School full of enthusiasm and excitment that I will study what stuff that I like and makes me happy.
As I have studied, I have started to find out that it is not the kind that brings me joy when I poke my nose into it, that it is actually games!

After graduation I have definitely started to thinking about a starting line in the videogame industry.

## Experience

**2 weeks**
Freelance

I have got an oportunity to beta test a videogame called Rustler as the devs have been giving out the beta keys for people willing to test the game for free and file a report for it afterwards. I have spent about 2 weeks in the game, which was quite a parody for an old GTA style of game set in the medieval era and full of pop culture references. I have liked it.

Freelance

After some time later, a small dev studio posted a question if any of the people would be willing to test an alpha demo of their game before releasing it as an full demo.

At the start of the alpha test, I had some technical issues as the game was not willing to start and kept crashing, but after some patches I have managed to make it work and sweep thru the small 2 hours long technical demo of the game, which featured the first hours of the nuclear powerplant accident.
